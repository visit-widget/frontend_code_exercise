# Visit Widget Frontend Code Exercise

## About

A sample file, `Tutorial.tsx`, of old code from our React Native app that has been wrapped with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/)
to make it easier to run. Below are steps to get the code up and running, and then directions on completing the exercise. It
is estimated that the code exercise will take 2-4 hours, and there will be follow up questions and discussion of the submission at
the subsequent technical interview.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. From root, run `npm i -g expo-cli`
3. From root, run `yarn`
4. From root, run `yarn web` or `yarn ios` to start the app in either browser or iOS simulator (not necessary for completion)

## Exercise

Please refactor `src/modules/screens/tutorial/Tutorial.tsx` as you see fit. The goal of this exercise is for us
to gain an understanding of your personal coding style. Any other files exist only so the app can run, albeit not
pretty or user friendly, for the benefit of the applicant if it might prove helpful. The exercise
will be analyzed purely from a review of the code and _not_ it running or how it looks in browser/simulator.

## Submission

Once complete, please respond to the email in which you received this code exercise with either a zip of all the code or a url
of a fork that is publicly accessible. We will analyze the code, and followup with next steps. Thank you!
